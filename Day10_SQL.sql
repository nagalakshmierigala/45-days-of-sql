-- The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
-- (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
-- machine_id is the ID of a machine.
-- process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
-- activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
-- timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
-- 'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
-- The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
-- There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
-- The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. 
--- The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
-- The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
-- Return the result table in any order.
-- The result format is in the following example.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.machine_id, round(avg(b.timestamp - a.timestamp), 3) as processing_time 
from activity a join activity b
on a.machine_id = b.machine_id and a.process_id = b.process_id and a.activity_type = 'start' and b.activity_type = 'end'
group by 1;

-- empId is the column with unique values for this table.

-- empId is the column of unique values for this table.
-- empId is a foreign key (reference column) to empId from the Employee table.
-- Each row of this table contains the id of an employee and their respective bonus.
-- Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.
-- Return the result table in any order.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e.name, b.bonus
from employee e left join bonus b on e.empid = b.empid
where b.bonus <1000 or bonus is null;
